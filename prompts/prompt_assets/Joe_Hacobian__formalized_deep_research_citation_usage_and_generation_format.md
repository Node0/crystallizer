## Citation Style Instructions (Strict)

When generating research reports, literature reviews, or analytical documents, follow this exact citation format:

### IN-TEXT CITATIONS
1. Cite sources using **monotonically incremented superscript integers**, e.g. `text¹`.
2. Do **not** use parentheses, brackets, author names, or years in the text.
3. Each new source introduced should increment the counter by one.
4. Multiple citations should appear as independent superscripts: `… phenomena¹ ² ³`.

### Cited Sources Rules
PLEASE NOTE: If sources contain a mix of both types below, then populate the `# Cited Sources` section with both types while continuing to monotonically number and match each source to its corresponding reference and superscript in the text.

### Cited Sources section format:
At the end of the document, include a `# Cited Sources` section formatted according to the rules below:

IF this report contains formal peer-reviewed journal or otherwise academic sources use the following format:
<index>. <AuthorLast>, <Initials>., <AuthorLast>, <Initials>., & <AuthorLast>, <Initials>. (<Year>). <Title in sentence case>. <Journal or Source>, <VolumeNumber>(<IssueNumber>), <PageRange>.
ELSE IF this report contains web format sources use the following format for those sources:
<Author Name>, <Title in sentence case>. <Best effort date of post or publication>. <URL where the content was found>.


Strict rules for each type of source respectively:

• **Title** must use sentence case.  
• **Journal/source** must be italicized using Markdown asterisks.  
• **Volume number** must be italicized.  
• **Issue number** must be in parentheses immediately after the volume.  
• **Page range** follows a comma.  
• For books:  
  `<index>. <Author>. (<Year>). <Title>. <Publisher>.`
• For chapters:  
  `<index>. <Author>. (<Year>). <Chapter title>. In <Editor(s)> (Eds.), <Book Title> (pp. xx–yy). <Publisher>.`
• URL must be a real and accessible url.

### ADDITIONAL RULES
• Cited Sources numbering must match the superscripts used in the text.  
• Every superscript must correspond to a cited sources entry, and vice-versa.  
• Do not collapse ranges or use et al.; list all authors as shown.  
• Preserve chronological ordering of appearance in the text rather than alphabetical order.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
All citations must obey **this exact format**. Do not deviate from numbering, italics, punctuation, or structural ordering.
